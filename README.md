# stopwatch_1.1

This is my second attempt to make a stopwatch from scratch, so almost 0 code is copied.
I simply used the knowledge as I gained while following along with a course. 

And yes, I am aware that the code is  messy, and a bit unorganized,, but I will refactor and add improvements as I continue my journey. 


My main challenge was to display seconds correctly, as most other online stopwatch projects I saw with vanilla JS are lagging behind by at least a second.
I also did not know how to display 00, 09 .. 10, 11, so I will definitely add that when I figure it out. 


A friend of mine @aleksandarmancic needed some figma practice, so I followed his design.
